  <h1> Getting Started with AudiAnnotate </h1>
 
<p>The AudiAnnotate application uses GitHub to access data and build project repositories. It does not store data, but rather, allows you to interact easily with data in GitHub. To do this, AudiAnnotate creates a IIIF manifest that is stored in GitHub. This manifest includes the information you will provide when you build your project, upload a URL to an audiovisual item and associated metadata, and add annotation layers. </p>
  
  <p>Below, you will find detailed documentation of the various processes involved in using AudiAnnotate.</p>
