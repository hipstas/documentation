    <h1>Collaboration via Hypothesis</h1>
    
    <p><a href="https://web.hypothes.is/about/">Hypothesis</a> is “a conversation layer over the entire web that works everywhere, without needing implementation by any underlying site.” Integrating Hypothesis with an AudiAnnotate project allows for a layer of commentary on top of AudiAnnotate annotations from multiple contributors. When annotating with Hypothesis, you can annotate in a group or individually, privately or publicly.</p>
