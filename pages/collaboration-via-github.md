    <h1>Collaboration via GitHub</h1>
    <p><a href="#shared">Creating a Shared Repository</a> | <a href="#fork">Fork and Pull</a>
      
    <p>There are two methods of creating collaborative projects in GitHub. The simplest method is the Shared Repository, where one user creates an AudiAnnotate project and additional users are manually invited to join that project by the initial user. The second, more complex method is to use GitHub's "fork" and "pull" features. This method involves one user creating a repository and additional collaborators making a copy of that repository using GitHub’s fork (i.e., copy) feature, making changes, and making pull requests which can then be merged into the original repository after being reviewed and approved by the repository owner.</p>

    <h2 id="shared">Creating a Shared Project</h2>
    
    <p>To create a shared repository (i.e., project), first create a project in AudiAnnotate. Once created, you will be able to give collaborators access to the generated repository through GitHub. You can invite collaborators by their GitHub username or by their email address. If they do not already have a GitHub account, the invitation will prompt them to create an account.</p>

    <h2 id="fork">Fork and Pull</h2>
    
    <p>After the original owner of the repository has created a project, added audiovisual material(s), and attached annotations, they can provide collaborators with a link to the repository in GitHub. With that link, collaborators will be able to "fork" (copy) the repository into their own GitHub account. They can make changes to their copy of the repository before submitting a "pull" request to the original owner. The owner will be notified of the request and have the option to either adopt the changes or reject them.</p>

      <ul>
        <li>First, change the repository's URL so that it includes your username rather than the original owner's.</li>

        <br>
        <br>
        
        <li>Next, your forked repository needs to be manually associated with AudiAnnotate. You'll do this by adding the AudiAnnotate "topic" to the repository.</li>

        <br>
        <li>Save your changes.</li>
      </ul>
      
      <li>Because your project was forked, AudiAnnotate did not automatically generate a webpage for it. To force this creation, edit the README file on the repository page. Select the pencil icon on the README file to make edits.</li>

      <br>
      <br>
      
      <li>Add any text to the README file. We suggest text that shares the origins of the repository, e.g.: “Forked from [username of original user]/[repository name].” (This text will display on the AudiAnnotate site project tile to signal that this is a forked repository.) Commit your changes.</li>
    
    </ol>
    
    <h3><i>Editing a Forked Repository</i></h3>
    <p>When you edit a forked repository, you make no effect on the original project. Edits will have to be approved by the project's original owner in order to be merged into the original project.</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>Navigate to your projects page in AudiAnnotate. You should see a project tile for your forked repository there—look for the "Forked from..." text on the tile.</li>

      <li>Click the edit button and proceed to make changes as desired.</li>

      <li>Once your changes have been made, you must submit a pull request wihtin GitHub. Navigate to the GitHub repository page and select the "Pull request button".</li>

    <h3><i>Responding to a Pull Request</i></h3>
    <p>Once a collaborator has created a pull request requesting a change in a repository that you own, you will have to review it and merge the changes.</p>
    
    <ol>
      <li>GitHub will send an email notification when a pull request has been created. This email will provide a link to the pull request made by the collaborator.</li>
      
      <br>
      
      <li>When you open the pull request, you will see the changes being requested by the collaborator. You can select into the files where changes are being. Additions to each file appear in green with a plus (+) sign at the start of the row, while items being deleted appear in red with a minus (-) sign.</li>
